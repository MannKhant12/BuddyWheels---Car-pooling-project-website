Here’s a clean, minimal README you can use for **BuddyWheels**:

# BuddyWheels 🚗💨

BuddyWheels is a simple and user-friendly carpooling platform designed to connect drivers and passengers for shared rides, helping reduce travel costs, traffic, and carbon emissions.

## Features

* **Offer a Ride** – Drivers can post available seats and travel details.
* **Search a Ride** – Passengers can find rides that match their route and time.
* **Connect & Ride** – Easy chat and booking confirmation for a smooth experience.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
* **Backend:** (Add if applicable, e.g., Node.js, PHP, etc.)
* **Database:** (Add if applicable, e.g., MySQL, MongoDB)

## How It Works

1. **Post or Search a Ride** – Enter trip details.
2. **Connect with Others** – Chat or confirm via the platform.
3. **Ride Together** – Share the journey and split the cost.

If you want, I can also make a **shorter version** that looks more like a lightweight “student project” README. That might fit better for your current stage.
